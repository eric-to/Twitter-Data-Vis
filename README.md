# twitter-data-vis - visualizing trends around mental health

## Background and Overview

Twitter is a useful mechanism to get a pulse on a topic of conversation. For example, what are the most popular (liked, retweeted, engaged with) Tweets around the #MeToo movement? What do people in South America have to say about #Trump?

The goal of this project is to parse and visualize high-level themes around mental health conversations happening on Twitter; not just using Tweet content and attributes (like geolocation), but also using sentiment analysis. Through this, I hope to illustrate the deltas in mental health discussions happening around the world that might not otherwise be obvious.

## Functionality and MVP

Through TwitterDataVis, users will be able to:

- [ ] See visualized high-level themes pertaining to mental health discussions on Twitter
- [ ] Click through into each theme to digh deeper into details about each one, including frequency and sentiment analysis
- [ ] Filter dynamically by search term and geolocation
